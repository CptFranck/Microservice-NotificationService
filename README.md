# üì¶ Microservice - Notification Service

The **Notification Service** is a real-time component of the microservice architecture.  
It manages **user notifications**, subscribes to **Kafka topics** emitted by other services (e.g., Booking, Inventory), and updates the front-end via **WebSocket/STOMP**.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This service is responsible for providing **instant updates to connected clients**.  
It listens to events published on Kafka topics and broadcasts them to users in real-time via WebSocket.  
The front-end can subscribe to `/user/{userId}/bookings` or other destinations to receive notifications.

## üß© Architecture Integration

![Architecture du projet](docs/schemaProject.png)

The Notification Service is part of a **5-repository microservice ecosystem**:

1. **Common** ‚Äì Shared DTOs and utilities used across services.  
2. **Booking Service** ‚Äì Handles bookings, emits events to update inventory and notify users.  
3. **Inventory Service** ‚Äì Maintains venue and event stock, emits events for updates.  
4. **Notification Service** ‚Äì Subscribes to Kafka topics from Booking and Inventory, pushes updates to front-end via WebSocket.  
5. **API Gateway** ‚Äì Central entry point for external clients, handles routing, security, WebSocket proxying, and documentation.

The Notification Service connects primarily with **Kafka topics** from other services and pushes real-time notifications to users.  
Authentication and authorization for WebSocket endpoints are enforced using **Keycloak**.
